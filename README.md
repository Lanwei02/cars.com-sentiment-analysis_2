# cars.com-sentiment-analysis_2
This project is an upgrade of my previouse [project analyzed Toyota Camry(2012-2017) review data downloaded from cars.com](https://github.com/Lanwei02/cars.com-sentiment-analysis_1)

However, since the available Carmy user reviews are too less to create a robust sentiment classifier, the accuracy of the model is very low. So I wanted to improve this project by expanding the review data range from Toyota Camry to several popular sedans in the US car market and fine-tuned pipeline combined by different text vectorized methods and machine learning algorithms to build a better sentiment classifier and also explore more insights from the review data.

* First, I wrote a [new crawler](https://github.com/Lanwei02/cars.com-sentiment-analysis_2/blob/master/car_scrapper.ipynb) with python which could scrap the star, review, review date and review area of the selected car (make, model and year). The package I used in this file is beautifulsoup. I also updated the [crawler written by R](https://github.com/Lanwei02/cars.com-sentiment-analysis_2/blob/master/CARS_CRAWLER.R) since there are some changes to the website which made the original crawler does not work well.
